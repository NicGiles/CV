## Nic Giles : Software Engineer

I am a determined, creative and enthusiastic Full Stack Developer. 

I’m looking for a role in which I can continue to grow and enhance my programming ability, whilst also contributing to a motivated and knowledgeable team.

I have recently completed Makers Academy, an intensive 12-week software development bootcamp designed to provide the perfect growth platform for a successful career in software engineering, with a particular focus on test-driven development.

During the course I was able to gain experience using the following languages and tools: 
Ruby, Rspec, Capybara, Rails, Devise, Sinatra, Javascript, Jasmine, Zombie, React, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Jest, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, WebSockets, Heroku, AWS, Travis CI, Spotify’s Web API.

I have a degree in Economics and a Masters in Geopolitics & Grand Strategy.

 I have previously worked as a digital performance analyst and believe a lot of the analytical and problem solving skills to be transferable in my new career as a developer.
